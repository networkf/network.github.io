<b><font size="5">Proof of Network</font></b>
<br>
<br>
_Please note as of December 2023 Proof of Network has not been launched yet due to unclear US regulatory environment._
<br>
<br>
Proof of Network is our mechanism by which we plan to distribute the network token to the public. The mechanism is as follows:

1. The network broadcasts specific problems to the community with number of tokens if problem solved.
2. The first person who solves the problem wins.
3. The network will pay gas fees and distribute agreed upon number of tokens to person who solves problem.

Over time, the token holders will be able to broadcast problems and decide on amount of tokens to be distributed for each problem. As each problem may carry a different weight, a fair calculation will have to be made.

**Network Token Distribution Tracker:**
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m9o-NVi9G2ksfayXTmo8XrTnp5_gyz4v4nxIQ5MIs8Y

We will update the tracker continuously and post new problems that need to be solved. Proof of network is a novel concept and will also be continuously improved upon with the help of everyone involved. Those that hold the token are going to help to bootstrap the network and they will govern the direction of the network. The use case of the token will evolve over time. Â
