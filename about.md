<b><font size="5">About Network</font></b>
<br>
<br>
**Welcome to the Dreamworld**
<br>
<br>
Our vision for the Network is to serve as a portal to the realm of dreams. The Network is not merely a technological advancement; it is a diverse ecosystem comprising individuals and organizations that collaboratively construct and expand the Network. The Network ecosystem was not meticulously crafted by a single person or entity; rather, it has flourished through the collective efforts of those who care for and foster its growth, resulting in a more vibrant and varied ecosystem.
<br>
<br>
This is the foundation website of Network. Our network is comprised of the decentralized foundation that supports Network, the company developing the interface to the dreamworld.
