Network's mission is to revolutionize dream exploration technology and empower individuals with independence from their mind. Our goal is to accelerate the advent of the dreamworld and usher in a new paradigm for mental health and mobility. We envision a future in which individuals can consciously dream at will, experience their mind in a virtual reality environment and utilize those experiences to delve into the nature of their mind, heal themselves, and create mental mobility. We are also striving towards a global neuroscience technology market for dreamscape navigation, focusing on open-source tools and research to encourage collaboration and tackle common industry challenges.
