<b><font size="5">About</font></b>
<br>
<br>
Network's mission is to accelerate the advent of dream exploration technologies and empower individuals to be free from their mind. 

We are building an interface to the dream world, from which individuals can dream consciously on demand and experience their mind in a virtual reality setting. We are building tools that people can use to use their dreams to find freedom from their mind. 

We are also building a global neuroscience technology market, emphasizing open-source tools and research to foster collaboration and solving common goals that the industry faces.
