<b><font size="5">About</font></b>
<br>
<br>
Network's mission is to revolutionize dream exploration technology and empower individuals with independence from their mind. Our goal is to accelerate the advent of the dreamworld and introduce a new paradigm for mental mobility. 

We are constructing a laboratory where individuals can consciously dream at will and dive into a virtual reality of their own mind in order to free themselves from the loops that govern their lives.

We are also working towards a global market for dreamscape navigation, focusing on open-source tools and research to encourage collaboration and tackle common industry problems.
