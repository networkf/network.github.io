## Network

Welcome to the network. network.foundation is your portal into the world of Network. This is a directory from which you can explore everyting related to the network.

## What is Network?

Network is the brain computer network to power virtual dreams and home of neural interface technology to experience a new state of mind. Network's mission is to accelerate the advent of virtual worlds and create an alternative model for self-governance. We are building tools to empower individuals to break free from infinite mental loops, to explore the nature of their mind and to find liberty to dream freely.

<b>Abstract:</b> A decentralized brain computer network would allow anyone in the world to participate in exploring the frontier of the brain while creating a strong forcing function to accelerate the number of neurons we can currently interface with. A network of peer-to-peer brain computers would empower individuals to own the data that would flow between brains and computers. By creating a network of open, permissionless protocols for brain computers, a diverse set of stakeholders will govern and guide its future. Virtual dreams as a novel medium could become an alternative reality to explore the nature of reality and accelerate progress in the mind sciences. Other brain computer applications could be developed as tools for individuals to heal and liberate themselves and others.
