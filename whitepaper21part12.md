<b><font size="5">Network Whitepaper | Part 12 — Principles & Conclusion</font></b>

By Link Daniel

<i>Original Publication Date: January 21, 2021</i>

<h3>Principles</h3>

Decentralized. The future of technology rests on decentralized principles. The network needs to be open and permissionless in order to ensure access from the widest and most diverse group of stakeholders. We also need to make sure that the network will not be turned off by any nefarious actors.

Incentives. We want to align the incentive of early stakeholders to work together and contribute value to bootstrap the network successfully. We want to create a system that rewards individuals for solving problems that unlock growth for the network.

Identity. At the heart of virtual dreams are humans that use brain computer links to connect to a network that allows them to experience virtual dreams and connect with others in a virtual world. We need to ensure that individuals own the identity and the passport that they use to enter the virtual world and exit into the material world.

Governance. The network will be bootstrapped by early stakeholders that get the token in return for providing value that grows the network. We propose a system whereby a diverse set of stakeholders will govern its future through a decentralized autonomous organization.

Open source. It is only because of open source systems that the network was able to exist and continues to exist. We stand on the shoulders of those giants who have created great open source technology. We value the community and will develop the network in an open source manner. We will connect with different stakeholders to ensure that we will have a secure, robust platform that will enable future innovation.

Safety. As we charter into the unexplored frontier of the brain and the mind, we must ensure safety at all times from the hardware that will allow us to go into the virtual world to keeping individual’s identity and their data and dreams safe. We need to design the system as such that safety is a requirement. As an industry we need to strive to guarantee safety at all times. Safety is everyone’s priority.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

Our purpose is to accelerate the advent of brain computers and create virtual dreams as a novel medium in order to experience an alternative reality of the mind. We are building an open, permissionless network between brains and computers that will allow individuals to connect their brain computer link to the virtual world.

Virtual dreams as a medium will empower individuals to liberate themselves and give them tools to help themselves break out of the infinite loops that run their lives. We introduced virtual dreams, a novel medium that leverages brain computer links to connect to the virtual world. At first, similar to the experience of a lucid dream, individuals will be able to connect into their own subconscious mind and explore the mental patterns that govern their lives. As we improve upon the experience of virtual dreams, we will be able to record and share them with the world. This will allow others to experience our dreams and see the world from our point of view. Eventually, they will be able to be experienced with others simultaneously. Ultimately, the network will allow individuals to use their brain computer link to connect to the virtual world which will be built on crypto- economic principles guaranteeing that data will be owned by the respective dreamers. As the virtual world expands, we will create an identity passport which serves as an avatar to guarantee that entry into the virtual world and exit into the material world will be cryptographically secured at all times.

In order to get to this future of virtual dreams, we need to accelerate and catalyze the neuro revolution. We aim to unite the brain computer industry to collaborate and work together towards the primary shared goal of brain computers being able to interface with billion of neurons simultaneously. An open and decentralized brain computer network will allow a vast number of diverse stakeholders to explore this new frontier of the brain and mind in a meaningful way. We are not standing in competition with the industry as it currently exists and merely wish to augment what is missing. We want to guarantee that individuals using the brain computer link of their choice can have peace of mind that they own the dreams they choose to go into.

By creating an open, permissionless network we will allow anyone from anywhere in the world to participate and build their own brain computer application. We also hope that existing players will join us in solving common problems that we are all facing together. As a result of the nature of permissionless systems, others will be able to create algorithms that could be used to heal individuals. They could heal those that are suffering from various mental patterns and different kinds of infinite loops. Our goal is to offer a neutral medium that would allow others to build brain computer applications that could heal people. We are building a medium for tools that individuals could use to change their own state of mind and increase awareness to make lasting changes in their own lives. Ultimately, we are creating virtual dreams to empower individuals to liberate themselves.

Despite the odds and obstacles, the adventure of this journey will be unparalleled as we explore this unknown frontier together. Virtual dreams will become a path for others to step into liberty and increase the light of consciousness.
